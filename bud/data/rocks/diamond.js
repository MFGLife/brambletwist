    ["What is the chemical composition of Diamond?", "The chemical composition of Diamond is pure carbon (C), where each carbon atom is bonded to four other carbon atoms in a tetrahedral arrangement. This unique structure gives diamond its exceptional hardness, brilliance, and optical properties.", ""],
    ["How is Diamond formed?", "Diamonds form deep within the Earth's mantle under high pressure and temperature conditions. They are typically formed from carbon-bearing materials subjected to intense heat and pressure over millions to billions of years. Diamonds are brought to the Earth's surface through volcanic eruptions or via geological processes such as kimberlite and lamproite pipes.", ""],
    ["Where is Diamond typically found?", "Diamonds are found in various regions around the world, with significant deposits located in Africa, Russia, Australia, Canada, and South America. They occur primarily in ancient volcanic pipes and alluvial deposits, as well as in sedimentary rocks and meteorites.", ""],
    ["What are the physical properties of Diamond?", "Diamond is renowned for its exceptional hardness (10 on the Mohs scale), high refractive index, brilliance, and luster. It has a cubic crystal structure, excellent thermal conductivity, and is transparent to opaque depending on clarity and impurities.", ""],
    ["Is Diamond rare or common?", "While diamonds are relatively common in the Earth's mantle, gem-quality diamonds suitable for jewelry are relatively rare. They represent a small fraction of the total diamond production, with the majority being used for industrial purposes such as cutting, drilling, and grinding.", ""],
    ["What are some common uses of Diamond?", "Diamonds are primarily used in jewelry making, including engagement rings, necklaces, earrings, and bracelets. They are also valued for their industrial properties and are used as abrasives, cutting tools (e.g., diamond saws and drills), heat sinks, and in high-performance electronics (e.g., diamond-based semiconductors).", ""],
    ["How can I identify Diamond?", "Identifying diamonds involves assessing their physical properties such as hardness, brilliance, clarity, and optical characteristics. Gemological tests such as magnification, refractive index measurement, and spectroscopy can also help distinguish diamonds from other gemstones and materials.", ""],
    ["What is the history and lore surrounding Diamond?", "Diamonds have a long history of fascination and symbolism, dating back thousands of years. They have been associated with wealth, power, and romance and have been revered by ancient civilizations as symbols of purity, strength, and invincibility. Diamonds continue to hold cultural significance and are often used to commemorate special occasions such as engagements and weddings.", ""],
    ["How is Diamond mined or extracted?", "The mining of diamonds involves various methods depending on the geological setting and deposit type. This can include open-pit mining, underground mining, alluvial mining, and marine mining (e.g., offshore diamond mining). Once extracted, diamonds are sorted, processed, and graded for use in jewelry or industrial applications.", ""],
    ["Are there any interesting facts about Diamond?", "Here are some fascinating facts about diamonds: Diamonds are the hardest natural substance known to man and can only be scratched by other diamonds. They are formed from carbon atoms subjected to extreme pressure and temperature conditions deep within the Earth's mantle. Additionally, diamonds can exhibit a wide range of colors, including white, yellow, blue, pink, and red, with colored diamonds known as fancy diamonds being particularly rare and valuable.", ""],
    ["What is Diamond?", "Diamond is a rare and precious gemstone composed of pure carbon atoms arranged in a crystalline structure. It is renowned for its exceptional hardness, brilliance, and clarity, making it one of the most sought-after gemstones for jewelry and adornment. Diamonds also have significant industrial applications due to their hardness and thermal conductivity.", ""],
