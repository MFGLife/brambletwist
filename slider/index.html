                Dogwood trees are known for their beautiful spring blooms, which consist of small flowers surrounded by four large bracts that resemble petals. These trees are ideal for adding ornamental value to landscapes and gardens. 
        
                In addition to their striking appearance, dogwood trees are relatively easy to care for, requiring regular watering and well-drained soil. They prefer partial shade and can thrive in various soil types.

                  <li>Plant type: Tree</li>

                  <li>Duration: Perennial</li>
                  <li>Mature height: 15-30 feet </li>
                  <li>Fun Fact: Flowering Dogwood is used as a soil improver because their leaf litter decomposes more quickly than a lot of other trees.</li>
                  <li>Traditional Uses: Dogwood bark has been used in medicinal teas and tinctures often used to treat malaria especially during the civil war when quinine was hard to come by. </li>
                  <li>Modern Uses: Dogwood wood is extremely hard and often used for specialty items requiring heavy repeated use like golf club heads and knitting needles.</li>

                Horsetail is a unique plant that adds a touch of elegance to any garden or landscape. With its upright, jointed stems and feathery appearance, horsetail is often used to create architectural interest in garden beds and borders. 
        
                This plant is relatively low-maintenance and can tolerate a wide range of growing conditions, including moist or dry soil and full sun to partial shade. However, it is important to contain its spread as horsetail can become invasive if not properly managed.

                  <li>Fun Fact: The Equisetum family are considered living fossils with the earliest detection dating back to the Jurassic period.</li>
                    <li>Traditional Uses: Horsetail has been used medicinally and as an abrasive for cleaning fingernails and hurdy-gurdy strings to remove resin build up. </li>
                    <li>Modern Uses: Horsetail extracts are approved for use as fungicides in the European Union and United Kingdom.</li>

                Cushion moss, also known as pincushion moss or pillow moss, adds a touch of whimsy and soft texture to gardens, terrariums, and landscapes. This low-growing moss forms dense, rounded cushions in shades of light blue-green to green, transforming into a vibrant green when moist and creating a unique textural element that complements various design styles.
                 Thriving in shady or partially shaded locations with moist but well-drained soil, cushion moss is relatively easy to care for. It prefers acidic to neutral conditions and adapts well to some drought, though consistent moisture encourages optimal growth. Additionally, cushion moss benefits the environment by helping retain soil moisture and suppress weed growth.
                <ul>
                  <li>Plant type: Moss</li>
                  <li>Hardiness zones: 3a-9b</li>
                  <li>Sun: Full shade to partial shade</li>
                  <li>Water needs: Moderate to high</li>
                  <li>Soil: Acidic, well-drained</li>
                  <li>Spreads by spores</li>
                  <li>Mature height: 1-3 inches </li>
                  <li>Fun Fact: Cushion moss can absorb up to seven times its weight in water! This adaptation allows them to survive in dry environments for extended periods, waiting for rain to revive them.</li>
                    <li>Traditional Uses: Moss has been used in wound dressing in ancient times for its moisture absorbency and antimicrobial properties.</li>
                    <li>Modern Uses: Moss is quickly becoming popular in urban development especially on roofs to control stormwater runoff and increase insulator values.</li>
