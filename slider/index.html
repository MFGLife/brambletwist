                Butterfly milkweed is a native wildflower you’ve probably seen growing in abundance in empty fields or by the roadside. Because these flowers do so well here on their own, they’re super easy to take care of! And best of all, they’ll attract butterflies and hummingbirds to your garden.  

With their appeal to beneficial wildlife, butterfly milkweed flowers make a perfect foundation for pollinator gardens. Showy clusters of bright orange flowers with a backdrop of dark green foliage also make butterfly milkweed a great addition to colorful wildflower beds.

                Does your yard typically have wet soil? Cardinal flowers could be a great choice for your garden. This plant does especially well in naturally moist areas, such as rivers or ponds. In ideal conditions, cardinal flowers will reseed themselves over and over again, so you can expect to enjoy their blooms for several years to come, even after the original plant dies. 

                Like their namesake bird, cardinal flowers are a beautiful bright red. The small, delicate petals bloom in upright clusters at the ends of long stems covered in spear-shaped leaves. You can use these plants as a striking background for flower beds or pollinator gardens.

                Fringe tree, also known as old man’s beard or sweetheart tree, is a small to mid-sized deciduous native. A fringe tree would work well as a sole specimen planting or as the focal point of a plant bed. 

The main appeal of fringe trees is their feathery clusters of white flowers that really pop against the bright green foliage. In full bloom, the flowers look sort of like a light dusting of snow. Fringe tree’s blooming season can last a long time, from late spring into mid-fall. In addition to their interesting look, these flowers produce a light, pleasant fragrance and attract birds.

                Dogwood trees are known for their beautiful spring blooms, which consist of small flowers surrounded by four large bracts that resemble petals. These trees are ideal for adding ornamental value to landscapes and gardens. 
        
                In addition to their striking appearance, dogwood trees are relatively easy to care for, requiring regular watering and well-drained soil. They prefer partial shade and can thrive in various soil types.

                Horsetail is a unique plant that adds a touch of elegance to any garden or landscape. With its upright, jointed stems and feathery appearance, horsetail is often used to create architectural interest in garden beds and borders. 
        
                This plant is relatively low-maintenance and can tolerate a wide range of growing conditions, including moist or dry soil and full sun to partial shade. However, it is important to contain its spread as horsetail can become invasive if not properly managed.

                Carpet moss, also known as sheet moss or forest moss, is a low-growing ground cover that forms dense mats in shady, moist areas. Its lush green color and soft texture make it an excellent choice for creating a natural carpet-like appearance in gardens, terrariums, and woodland landscapes. 
        
                This versatile plant is easy to grow and requires minimal maintenance once established. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and prefers shaded or partially shaded locations. Carpet moss can be used to add visual interest to pathways, rock gardens, and other outdoor spaces.
